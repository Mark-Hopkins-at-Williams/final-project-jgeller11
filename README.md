Instructions:

Open the gans.ipynb file, and have some fun! You shouldn't *have* to edit any code to get everything to run, but there are some points where we point out code you can edit if you want to play around with the model. We produced many models that were *not* included in the Jupyter notebook, either because they take a long time to train or because they just didn't give very good results, but if you're interested in seeing even more GANs, let us know and we can share our other repo with you.
